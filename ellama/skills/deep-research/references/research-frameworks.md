# Research Frameworks and Methodologies

This reference provides frameworks and methodologies that can guide the research process for different types of research questions.

## Research Question Frameworks

### The 5 W's + H Framework
For exploratory research, ensure coverage of:
- **Who**: Key players, stakeholders, researchers, organizations
- **What**: Core concepts, technologies, approaches, solutions
- **When**: Timeline, history, current state, future projections
- **Where**: Geographic distribution, domains, contexts of application
- **Why**: Motivations, drivers, problems being solved
- **How**: Implementation, mechanisms, processes, methodologies

### PESTLE Analysis Framework
For market/domain research:
- **Political**: Regulations, policies, government initiatives
- **Economic**: Costs, market size, funding, economic impact
- **Social**: User adoption, cultural factors, societal impact
- **Technological**: Innovation, technical capabilities, limitations
- **Legal**: Compliance, intellectual property, standards
- **Environmental**: Sustainability, resource usage, ecological impact

### SWOT Analysis Framework
For comparative or evaluative research:
- **Strengths**: Advantages, capabilities, unique features
- **Weaknesses**: Limitations, gaps, disadvantages
- **Opportunities**: Potential applications, growth areas, synergies
- **Threats**: Risks, challenges, competing solutions

## Information Quality Assessment

### Source Credibility Criteria
Evaluate sources based on:
1. **Authority**: Author credentials, institutional affiliation
2. **Accuracy**: Citations, peer review, verification
3. **Objectivity**: Bias, conflicts of interest, perspective
4. **Currency**: Publication date, relevance to current state
5. **Coverage**: Depth, comprehensiveness, scope

### Evidence Hierarchy
Prioritize evidence types (strongest to weakest):
1. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews
2. Peer-reviewed research studies
3. Technical documentation from primary sources
4. Expert analysis and whitepapers
5. Industry reports and surveys
6. News articles and blog posts
7. Anecdotal evidence and opinions

## Research Depth Levels

### Level 1: Overview (Quick Research)
- Basic definitions and concepts
- Key players and notable examples
- High-level pros/cons or features
- **Depth**: 3-5 sources, 1-2 pages

### Level 2: Standard Analysis (Moderate Research)
- Detailed explanations and mechanisms
- Multiple examples and case studies
- Comparative analysis of options
- Identification of trends and patterns
- **Depth**: 10-15 sources, 5-10 pages

### Level 3: Deep Dive (Comprehensive Research)
- Technical implementation details
- Historical context and evolution
- Extensive comparative analysis
- Critical evaluation and synthesis
- Multiple perspectives and viewpoints
- Edge cases and limitations
- Future directions and implications
- **Depth**: 20+ sources, 15+ pages

## Synthesis Strategies

### Thematic Synthesis
Group findings by themes/topics:
1. Identify recurring themes across sources
2. Organize information by theme
3. Analyze relationships between themes
4. Build cohesive narrative

### Chronological Synthesis
Organize by timeline:
1. Establish historical context
2. Trace evolution and development
3. Identify key milestones and transitions
4. Connect past to present state

### Comparative Synthesis
Structure around comparisons:
1. Define comparison criteria
2. Evaluate each option against criteria
3. Identify patterns and trade-offs
4. Provide framework for decision-making

### Framework-Based Synthesis
Use established frameworks:
1. Select appropriate framework (PESTLE, SWOT, etc.)
2. Map findings to framework categories
3. Ensure comprehensive coverage
4. Derive insights from framework application

## Common Research Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking only sources that support initial assumptions
2. **Recency Bias**: Over-weighting recent sources for non-time-sensitive topics
3. **Source Echo Chambers**: Citing multiple sources that reference the same original source
4. **Shallow Coverage**: Broad but superficial research without depth in key areas
5. **Over-Technical**: Excessive jargon without explanations for intended audience
6. **Missing Context**: Presenting findings without necessary background or implications
7. **Weak Citations**: Vague or missing source attribution
8. **Synthesis Gaps**: Collecting information without meaningful analysis or connection

## Report Quality Checklist

- [ ] Clear executive summary captures key findings
- [ ] All technical terms defined on first use
- [ ] Multiple authoritative sources for key claims
- [ ] Conflicting information acknowledged and addressed
- [ ] Structured sections with logical flow
- [ ] Tables/lists used for complex comparisons
- [ ] Proper citations throughout [1], [2], etc.
- [ ] Complete references section with all sources
- [ ] Critical analysis beyond mere description
- [ ] Implications and conclusions clearly stated
- [ ] Limitations of research acknowledged
- [ ] Separate sources bibliography file created
